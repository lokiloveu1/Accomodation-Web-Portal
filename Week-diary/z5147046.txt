Who decided to do project 3.I did some research on where to scrape data from and after discussion with team members,I downloaded the data through airbnb api ,chose the useful data and uploaded it. \
We had the discussion about what technologies to use for the frontend, backend and api. We decided the database schema of our application and I suggested to use sqlite database.I wrote the first version of api.py including  \'91user creation\'92 and \'91user log in\'92.}
