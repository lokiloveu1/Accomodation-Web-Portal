week1:
We chose the project 3 as our topic. I discussed with the team members and found that we would use python for the backend and vue for the frontend.We talked about the database schema.

week2:
I set up the page for login and sign up. I fixed the problem of access control allow origin. Because this problem made the test api could not be used and after I added 'CORS(app,support_credentials=True)' into the api file, the test could be done. I also applied the check of password strength based on zxcvbn in the function of sign up to make sure user's password was strong enough.I also checked the data format that the api should return with my teammates.
