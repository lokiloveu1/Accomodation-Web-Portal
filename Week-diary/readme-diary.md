# Work Diary
Each student should maintain a work diary (call it z0001234.txt if your student
zId is z0001234) and check the file into GitHub.
From Week 1 onwards, we expect that you will update this file every week
with your new contributions to the team and the project. Check the file into
GitHub at least once a week (can be more frequent).
The content of the file should be brief but clear. 

For example, it should be like:

*Week 1*

*Group formed. I created the Trello & GitHub accounts for the team. Together
with John Smith, I wrote the Epic section of the proposal. I also found and
discussed with the team all available software tools and libraries that we
can use for the project.*

*Week 2*

*I wrote the first version of hello.c, api.h, api.c and drafted a design for
the Web service API between the client and the server – all by myself.*

You should also include either in this diary or in the GitHub (or Trello)
account the following information (if applicable) about the project progress:
- what was planned for the period since the last work diary entry
- what was finished
- what were the main technical and non-technical obstacles and how
they were overcome (or what was tried and did not work)
- what was not finished, why this happened, how this affects the overall
project progress and what adjustments (if any) are needed so the success
of the project is not endangered
- what is planned for the next period (e.g., next week)
We expect that other members of the team may access this file to know where
others are up to, but you should not modify your peer’s work diary.
