11156,19220,5/12/09,52946,Jeff,"Colleen was friendly and very helpful regarding directions, maps and suggestions for places to go.
Her flat is centrally located and it's easy to walk about the city from there or catch a bus/taxi right outside of her door. The train is only minutes away too.
The 'guest' has his/her own bedroom with a single bed and shares the bathroom. 
If I'm ever back in Sydney, I would certainly consider staying at Colleen's again. It was an enjoyable experience.

My friend Diemut from Germany enjoyed it a lot to stay with you. She was pleased about your openness, friendliness and your support according to discover Sydney. --- So if somebody wants to experience Sydney go to Colleen!!! I wish you a lot of guests who are as 'wunderbar' (wonderful) as you are. 

Sincerely

11156,207169,23/3/11,319306,Joyce,"This was such a wonderful experience.  Colleen was so helpful with written info on where to go what to see & how to get there and back.  We even did a couple of trips together.  The apartment was in a great location, with anything you need close by.  Bus stop right out the front door, train station, grocery, & eateries all along the street."
11156,221368,9/4/11,381951,Tim,"Fantastic host and location. 
Colleen has a wonderful home and is very kind in helping navigate the area. I really enjoyed my stay and would stay here again.

11156,381413,18/7/11,603460,Roberto,"Colleen is one of those formidable women, full of energy and stories to tell. Her place is superbly located down the road from King's Cross train station in Sydney. The location gives you easy access to Sydney's main attractions. The bed is comfy and her cat adorable. 

She will try to convince you to take buses to go to most places, but I found out that most things are doable on foot and it is a pleasure to walk in Sydney."
11156,453045,17/8/11,760698,Robert,"Lovely place to stay, like a home away from home. Colleen could not have been more helpful with directions and useful information.

Incredibly convenient location.

Will definitely recommend to my friends."
11156,674758,30/10/11,662632,Sabine,I really enjoyed staying with Colleen and Challie. I had a great time and her fruit salads and Gnocchi were the best I ever had. :) 
11156,698107,7/11/11,1133925,Juliette,I stayed with Colleen while I was in Sydney on a short business trip and it was a lovely home away from home!

12351,169641,12/1/11,205928,Lisa,"We stayed here for 5 days in January last year. The house was everything you could ask for when staying in central Sydney! 

The location for getting around the city was ideal, within walking distance of the city center. The neighborhood is very elegant and close to the Darling Harbour. There you can enjoy a drink and there's a lot of choice from nice restaurants and cosy bars. 

Vinh & Stuart are wonderful hosts! We talked, we laughed, we drank wine, we had a really good time here! Would stay here again anytime!"
12351,171791,18/1/11,80513,Lars,"We¬¥ve been with Vinh&Stuart for 4 nights in January 2011. Their home is lovely and looks really as shown.  It felt like coming home when they invited us to us their house. And in the evenings, coming back from an exciting day in Sydney,  Vinh was sitting at the table, ""ready"" for a litlle chat. The location is good: Bus stop, Supermarket, Cafe and great Thai across the street; 5 Minutes to Darling Harbour and 10 Minutes to Town Hall. Unfortunately they will move, so we¬¥ve been the last guests. But we hope, they will share their new apt in Sydney also with AirBnB."
12351,180715,11/2/11,303032,Kim,"Vinh and Stu are awesome hosts! Even their dog, Kenji was perfect - no barking just lots of love. Beautiful and clean home in Pyrmont, quieter then the CBD but literally a few minutes walk from it. Your own balcony, own bathroom really allowed us to have some time to ourselves plus the air conditioning really helped in the sweltering Australian heat. They are quite helpful in regards to answering any of your questions and they welcome you to use their laundry, kitchen and backyard patio as you please. Great guys - friendly, funny and sociable, I will definitely recommend to any of my friends who are looking for a place in Sydney!"
12351,182533,15/2/11,293562,Wilma,"This was my first airbnb experience and I really enjoyed it. Staying at Stuart and Vinh`s place was excellent. The location is great, close by public transport and restaurants, cafes. It`s only  a 10 min walk to the CBD. Stuart and Vinh are very open and friendly. I definitely recommend staying there."
12351,184011,18/2/11,329582,May,"We stayed with Vinh and Stuart for 3 days. We're so glad we found airbnb and especially that we stayed with Vinh and Stuart! Not only were they lovely but their home was comfortable and within walking distance to so many places! Vinh was lovely to chat with and even made Troy coffee. As we had a late flight on our last day, Vinh and Stuart were kind enough to let us leave our bags with them until we headed to the airport. Kenji is just as adorable and friendly as all the other comments say he is. If we visit Sydney again, we'd love to stay with Vinh and Stuart once more. "
12351,186619,22/2/11,351338,Chrissy,"Vinh & Stuart are most lovely hosts very warm and thoughtfull, Their comfy home is in a great location, a 2 min stroll down the road to heaps of lovely resturants so handy after a long day great choices if you want to grab a takeaway or dine in. Nice veiws of the harbour and a 15 min walk to darling harbour. Kenji their little dog is very freindly and very well behaved , I never heard a peep from him and was always there with a happy greeting each day. Great place comfy bed and great aircon. :)"
12351,188663,26/2/11,344653,David,"I spent a very memorable 3 nights in Sydney with Stuart and Vinh who where friendly, hospitable and excellent hosts‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ at ease with their new guest, as I was with them. Their home is just as you see it in the description and photos but the one thing that was really a bonus was the location. If you like walking, then just seconds away you can be walking down steps to the waterfront and passing the finger wharfs on the way to Darling Harbour. If you prefer to use public transport, then the light rail tram is just 2 mins away with a choice of stops. I tended to arrive back late at night but felt completely safe in this area. Just one minute away are several restaurants and my favourite was the Japanese where I had a mix of sushi and sashimi‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.all very fresh and served by enthusiastic and dedicated staff. My other favourite dish was breakfast where I was encouraged to just help myself to whatever I fancied in the kitchen. Stuart and Vinh are highly recommended and I have no hesitation in staying there again."
12351,192405,5/3/11,317160,Beth,"Staying with Vinh and Stu was my husband and my first Airbnb experience, and we have nothing but good things to say about it.  We spent most of our time out and about, but Vinh and Stu were very accomodating with our early mornings and late(ish) nights, and always available with suggestions for the day or encouragement to try Vegemite.  The house was gorgeous and in a great location.  Definitely recommended."
12351,196406,11/3/11,263945,Paul & Ruth,"We loved our stay at Vinh and Stuarts. From the moment we arrived, they made us feel so so welcome. The house is stunningly decorated and is located perfectly - just a short bus ride or 20 minute walk to Downtown. We enjoyed breakfast out in their garden overlooking the water and, after a day's sightseeing, we looked forward to catching up with our hosts in the evening. We could not have wished for a better - first-time - air bnb experience. "
12351,200392,16/3/11,354978,Shane,"My vacation in Sydney was a very memorable one. As with any time away from home, accomodation is a huge part of the overall experience. Vinh and Stuart have a great thing going and seem to have a really good handle on providing safe and comfortable lodging to their tourist guests. Their seemed to be no gap between the host and guest. It was one happy family and I especially enjoyed the Pyrmont neighbourhood. I'd surely be a repeat guest. Shane Doucette, Nova Scotia, Canada "
12351,208373,25/3/11,297196,Matthew,"Vinh and Stu's accommodations are great and they are both amazing hosts. I can't say enough good things about them during my week long stay in Sydney. What I loved about them was after a long day of sight-seeing, coming back to their place was always a fun time, knowing I would see both of them. We would talk for hours about everything from what I did that day to more in depth things like our background, our jobs, our family, our passions, etc. It was much more than just a place to sleep at night. You got a warm, homey, welcoming feeling staying at Vinh and Stu's that you would be extremely hard pressed to find at many 5 star hotels. And on top of that, their Pomeranian Kenji is the sweetest, cutest dog on the face of the earth. If you're a dog lover like I am, you will be at home knowing he will be excited to see you when you come home at night. All in all, I highly recommend Vinh and Stu to anyone thinking of staying in Sydney for business or pleasure. Next time I am back in Sydney, I will stay with Vinh and Stu (and Kenji) in a heartbeat."
12351,210037,27/3/11,119191,Effie,"Vinh and Stuart are really friendly and helpful hosts. They are always ready for any assist as per your request. They even helped to take our two heavy cases to upstairs. Vinh is really a good friend you can chat with on everything. Every morning you can find everything is in order and clean. You can use the kitchen and laundary as you are at home. The location of the accomodation is quite, safe to close to the city. It took us 15 minutes walk to Gorge St and tram and bus stop are 5 minutes away. Sitting in the living room for breakfast, you can see the harbor from the window and you can walk 2 minutes to touch the sea. The lovely dog Kenji is well behaved and always friendly to anyone. We will stay with Vinh and Stuart once more when we visit Sydney next time.

12351,215440,2/4/11,463922,Lisa,Vinh nd Stuart wrote such lovely words about me it is now my turn!!  I felt very very happy to be in their home.  It was my first airbnb experience and these guys were fantastic.  I didnt want to (Website hidden by Airbnb) fact I am going back next week.  Their home is not just a beautiful and gracious abode it is filled with such friendliness and has a great feeling to it which is because these guys are just the best!  Nothing was too much trouble.  Being away on business this was an alternative to soulless hotel rooms for me and at the end of the day it was so lovely to go home!  We had several great conversations and I found them both so interesting and easy to chat with.  If I keep saying nice things everyone will go there and I want to make sure there is a room for me everytime i go to Sydney!!!!  Five stars plus.  Thanks guys. Lisa
12351,219589,7/4/11,297196,Matthew,"Thanks again Vinh and Stu! I had a lovely time seeing you guys before I jetted out back to the States after my long 3 week holiday. I'm glad you guys enjoyed my photos and after our many conversations about them, I am ready to to pursue my passion and see where it takes me. And I can say now that I have friends' for life in Vinh and Stu. Such great, caring people I was fortunate to cross paths with through AirBnB. I will definitely try to make it back to Sydney in the future and will be staying with you guys in a heartbeat. Thanks again and stay in touch!"
12351,225253,13/4/11,391689,Katherine,"Staying at Stuart and Vihn's home was my first Airbnb experience and a very positive one. Prior to my arrival,Ii received very detailed directions to their house and other important information. Upon arrival and throughout my stay, they were both very cordial, informative and helpful with making my Sydney experience a positive one. Their condo is beautiful, clean and very strategically located to Darling Harbor. "
12351,230352,18/4/11,310824,Anna,"A very pleasurable experience: Vinh, Stuart, and Kenji are the perfect hosts. Recommended: sitting on the deck at the back looking out on the bay."
15253,62235434,13/2/16,3314081,Rob,"Great apartment in a perfect location! Spacious room with balcony and a view. Morag was easy to communicate with, friendly and very flexible. She even left us fresh home made bread every morning - thanks again for that :) We'd definitely stay here again!"
15253,62692706,16/2/16,49221119,Shuang,"The room was fine except for the bed which was a disaster. I hope I could show the pictures I took from the bed but airbnb does not support pictures in review. It had a huge dent and the surface was curved. It's very easy to roll towards the center. We are 2 sisters. We didn't want to cuddle in the bed center and it was so hard to stick at each side of the bed. I couldn't sleep all night on that slope and my back hurt.

We paid for 2 nights. But after one night in that terrible bed we decided to check in into a real hotel although the price was already very high and we could not get refund of the 2nd night for this room.

15253,63194541,21/2/16,25107206,Damien,"Morag went out of her way to make us feel at home. She left lovely treats to have at breakfast such as fresh bread, croissant and pod coffee.
"
15253,64042652,29/2/16,43347259,Christian,On our two months Trip to New Zealand and Australia we did a lot B&B - maybe some fourty different places. We always left a big recommendation! This time - we regret to say - we wouldn't choose the place of Morag again. We delivered the grounds and reasons a privat message to Morag.

15253,66612744,23/3/16,61315828,Heike,"Staying at darlinghurst is quite clever. On the left is darlingharbour and the City. On the right kings cross and surry hills is right around the corner. I can totally recommend staying with Morag. She is a wonderful host, she has even a map prepared with all information you need to have a good time in sydney. Very very helpful, total clever and very sweet."
15253,66953116,25/3/16,43987846,Niraj,"Morag is a very professional host who has managed her space very well; from a well-documented manual to bathrobes, slippers and baked delicacies for breakfast.  The location is very central; I particularly enjoyed the walk from Darlinghurst to the Sydney Harbor via the Botanical Gardens and back from Hyde Park."
15253,68221736,3/4/16,20283730,Kalpa,Morag was an extremely hospitable host and made me feel very welcome. The apartment is lovely and in a great location.

15253,69198744,10/4/16,4218232,Laurie,Morag's place was in a great location within a reasonable distance to most of the sights.  The breakfast items were a nice touch.  We only saw our host for a quick minute.
15253,69658411,12/4/16,24419125,Maree,Morag (and Charlie) was a great host and a delight to stay with! If you're looking for a welcoming and friendly place in a great location then this is the one for you!
15253,70294672,17/4/16,1424887,Jack,Morag's place was great.  It's very conveniently located to the trains and restaurants/ bars.  The apartment comes with a really nice terrace just off the bedroom.  Her instructions were super clear on how to get in and she had lots of helpful suggestions of things to do in Sydney.  I would surely stay there again.
