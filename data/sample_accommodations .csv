We're big fans of AirBnB for nearly a decade having used it when traveling in the USA not long after AirBnB first started.

Since then we've enjoyed traveling with AirBnB across the US, around Australia, in Hong Kong, and also in Vietnam. We're also hosts.

As guests we're always out & about most of the time and won't be intruding too much.

We're neat & tidy and vibrant conversationalists...

We operate ArtSHINE industries - Australia‚Äôs independent Creative Industries Enterprise Acceleration Platform + Launch Pad identifying, advancing, and funding commercially minded and innovative Creative Industries Professionals who focus on art, craft, artisanal making, design, fashion, entertainment, photography, music, writing, film & television, digital technology, and games & interactive content. ArtSHINE also incorporates a coffeehouse and coworking space; CoSydney CoWorking + Project Space, in the City of Sydney‚Äôs Chippendale Creative Precinct.

So here's an open invitation to come check us out.

My partner Vinh is a keen traveler who works a lot with artists and designers in his coaching practice. He's the energetic, vibrant one...

I lived in Bolivia for a year as a young man just out of school and have worked in social enterprises and not for profits over the years. I'm the more serious, bookish one (with a wicked sense of humour though). Currently working in financial services too...

One of the things we're keen to do is catch up with some social entrepreneurs, coworkers, not for profits, and microfinanciers.

We're particularly interested social enterprise, coworking, and small business incubators & mentoring projects.

More that happy to answer any questions that you may have.

If someone wants to pick my brain about what to do, where to go etc that is also fine. 
If someone wants to share a glass of wine and tell me about themselves that it also fine. 
I also have a little dog, Charlie he is a 9yr old Pomeranian that I have had since he was a puppy, he can gety a little excitable but generally is friendly and very cute.

There is lots of natural bush and wildlife in Mosman - the kookaburras and lorikeets are guaranteed to give you a noisy brilliant early morning dawn chorus in the summer time!  Our location is convenient for a harbour edge walk to Manly, and visiting Sydney's famous Taronga Zoo. Studio Yindi is a great base for seeing Sydney in detail.

There are lots of interesting cafes and restaurants within 10 minutes drive, many of which will also home deliver.","STANDARD OF ACCOMMODATION We pride ourselves on providing clean, comfortable accommodation, that represents excellent value for money.   We present Studio Yindi as the type of space we look for when we are travelling nationally or internationally ourselves.  If we can find places to stay that are excellent value for money then it means we can spend longer travelling for the same budget amount! If you are comfortable with comfortable but sometimes recycled furniture and Ikea style kitchen equipment, and do not expect an apartment styled ready to be published in a trendy home magazine, then you will feel very much at home.   But if you are expecting a 5 star hotel standard of accommodation then you will probably be more comfortable staying at a much more expensive Airbnb site,  or a 5 star hotel in the city centre.","GETTING TO STUDIO YINDI Upon confirming your booking we will provide you with the address and detailed instructions for reaching us by, car, taxi or public transport.

There is a key safe at the entrance door, so guests can arrive and depart independently, without needing to disturb the host and family who live upstairs in the same building.","We are happy to help guests with as much information as they need for an enjoyable tourist experience of Sydney.    We sometimes share a bottle of wine or a cup of tea/coffee with guests who have time to socialise.   Other guests are on a tight schedule of things to do, including weddings or conferences to attend so we hardly see them. We love having families stay with us.   Children who are into skateboarding will love the sloping chicane course offered by the street where we live.  2 boys from Sweden got very involved with the local skate board mob, and were still in contact with the skateboard mates years after they went home to Stockholm. Soccer, Aussie Rules football, or even cricket is often played by local children on our street,  which has very little through traffic.  But obviously children need to be supervised by their parents when they are playing on the street.","Studio Yindi is located in a very quiet suburban area. We value highly the implied support we have from our neighbours.  The most important thing you can do is to be quiet in the evening after 10 pm.   In particular do not stand outside chatting noisily to friends who may be arriving or leaving. After 10 pm please do not chat outside in the garden.  And please close all the sliding doors, so that any conversations you are having inside Studio Yindi are not heard by our immediate neighbours who are probably trying to sleep.

We became Airbnb.com hosts back in December 2010.   I was originally an architect, but worked in IT sales/marketing for the next 30+ years.  Semi-retired now,  I still manage consulting projects involving the Internet for small-medium businesses and some community based campaigns to promote better planning outcomes for the whole community, not just developers and their ‚Äútop end of town‚Äù mates.

I call myself an Internet Architect on my business card these days.  Most of my current projects involve marketing using social media tools.

A born and bred Sydneysider, I lived in UK for 10 years till 1984.  I have done lots of travel in Europe, Turkey, Egypt, Jordan, Sri Lanka, Thailand, China, Vietnam, Japan, New Zealand, USA. 

Studio Yindi incorporates the things we look for when selecting boutique hotels, pensions, hostels and B&Bs for ourselves - space, privacy, wifi Internet access, reading light at the bedside, comfortable and practical for working while ""on the road"", a bit unusual, a little surprise, and value for money. 

My own preferences are for adventure and off the beaten track, rather than luxury, international 5 star. 

We love meeting travellers from all parts of the world, and helping them enjoy the experience of a first visit to Sydney.

We have lots of experience assisting overseas based friends and colleagues to see the best parts of Sydney, using public transport, and avoiding the expensive tourist services.

Messing about on boats is one of my passions. I have a 7.2 m (24') yacht moored nearby on the harbour and know a lot about the nice parts of our extensive waterways, including its part in Australian history.  I love sharing tips on how to see the best of the harbour, using inexpensive public ferries, plus strolls around Cremorne Point from Mosman Bay, or the 3 - 4 hour walk from the Spit to Manly, via Sydney Harbour National Park.

We're big fans of AirBnB for nearly a decade having used it when traveling in the USA not long after AirBnB first started.

Since then we've enjoyed traveling with AirBnB across the US, around Australia, in Hong Kong, and also in Vietnam. We're also hosts.

As guests we're always out & about most of the time and won't be intruding too much.

We're neat & tidy and vibrant conversationalists...

We operate ArtSHINE industries - Australia‚Äôs independent Creative Industries Enterprise Acceleration Platform + Launch Pad identifying, advancing, and funding commercially minded and innovative Creative Industries Professionals who focus on art, craft, artisanal making, design, fashion, entertainment, photography, music, writing, film & television, digital technology, and games & interactive content. ArtSHINE also incorporates a coffeehouse and coworking space; CoSydney CoWorking + Project Space, in the City of Sydney‚Äôs Chippendale Creative Precinct.

So here's an open invitation to come check us out.

My partner Vinh is a keen traveler who works a lot with artists and designers in his coaching practice. He's the energetic, vibrant one...

I lived in Bolivia for a year as a young man just out of school and have worked in social enterprises and not for profits over the years. I'm the more serious, bookish one (with a wicked sense of humour though). Currently working in financial services too...

One of the things we're keen to do is catch up with some social entrepreneurs, coworkers, not for profits, and microfinanciers.

We're particularly interested social enterprise, coworking, and small business incubators & mentoring projects.

More that happy to answer any questions that you may have.

All the best,

Ever since Airbnb started in 2011, both of us (both separately and together) have listed our home/s in Sydney and (formerly) in Hong Kong.  We've successfully hosted and enjoyed meeting a swag of guests in the Airbnb international community from all cultures‚Äîsome whom we call friends and continue to stay in contact with. 

As Airbnb hosts, aside from covering the accommodation basics, our style is to be friendly and responsive to the needs of our guests.  Are you a first-time visitor to Sydney who's coming without a full itinerary?  We can give you the local scoop on a lot of great activities that you won't read about online or in your guide books (pottery classes? suggestions for families and kids?)  Or, for guests who already know the city or have it all figured out or ""just need a place to crash"", that's cool with us too.

As Airbnb guests, we've had fantastic stays with hosts in cities such as San Francisco, Istanbul and Berlin‚Äîenjoying the flexible option of the homestay which often beats the generic-faceless hotel-stay (especially when travelling solo), and also for its' much more affordable rate.  We also recognise that Airbnb hosts make excellent guests since they treat homes as if they were our own and take extra care to return everything as it was found.

You can hop on a train to the city from either Newtown or Erskineville Station and be there in around 15 minutes. Buses from King St will take you to the city, Broadway, Glebe, Coogee Beach and more.",Guests can access the whole house. Please be respectful of my personal belongings :),,"I know that if you're staying at my place you're probably on a holiday but there are still a few rules! 1. First and foremost, please consider my neighbours who may be slightly anxious about living near an Airbnb home. Little things like not smoking outside their homes, not being overly loud especially after 10pm and being friendly if you run into them will be appreciated by all and will help to maintain Airbnb's good reputation. 1. No smoking. If you're a smoker or one of your fellow guests is a smoker, please take advantage of the park across the road where you're least likely to upset anyone. 2. No loud parties (small dinner parties and gatherings are fine, but remember that you have neighbours who are more than likely not on holidays and may have to get up and go to work the next day) 3. Children under the age of 16 are not to be left at home without parental supervision as I'm not insured for any damage caused in these circumstances. 4.

Sharing my home (the street level) with Airbnb guests is one of the best things I've ever done. It's given me connections with many amazing people. I've found that the kind of people who choose Airbnb are adventurous, friendly, warm, intelligent, curious and often have fascinating stories to tell about their own lives.

When I travel, I stay at Airbnb places and each place I've chosen has been unique, full of character and has offered so much more than a stark and sterile hotel room. Meeting my hosts has been another benefit - they are all wonderful people.

I have a dog ‚Äì a Lagotto Romagnola ‚Äì whose name is Mucca and she shares my space upstairs. She's very friendly and lovable and is classified as 'hypoallergenic' so should not be a problem for guests with allergies.

In April this year (2019) I'm going to meet my granddaughter in the UK and will be making my whole home available for about 18 days.

::::THIS IS WHAT I WILL TELL YOU TO EXPECT POSITIVE AND NEGATIVES::::

Positive: I will help and make things easier for you in your stay, pick up from station when I can, leave food out if your hungry and you don't mind trying my/my family's food, and try and give you tips to save yourself here and there. I will as a host try and take care of you.

Negative: I am not a butler, you will be expected to clean up after yourself, follow house rules, keep the kitchen and public area in some order. You have to wear slippers (YES it is an Asian House), and sometimes other people will be staying so you do have to respect their space. I will also expect you to communicate if you wish to extend your stay or are running late.

All prices include, fully furnished, basic breakfast and tea and coffee, bread, pickup from station and clear directions to maximize your travellers time in the city ( As I am quite a traveller myself). Also wireless internet, toilet paper, soap and clean towels and access to a washing machine and kitchen which needs to be used carefully.

I also believe food is a great way to connect people and I love to source ingredients from markets and cook for my guests and it would be great if we could sit down over a meal and do the same and be able to do that. I am also able to converse in a variety of topics which include culture, music, politics and travel and would love to use a meal to get to know you as well. So all the prices MAY (depending on schedule) a personal cooking together and experience as we get to know each other if schedule suits.

I ONLY host people who I feel are in the same headspace and GENERALLY (but not always) no large families and people who BARGAIN BASEMENT my prices as they already very competitive.

Friendly, accommodating and willing to help you with inside knowledge whether you are here for a holiday, conference or just a weekend visit. Either way, I will help accommodate with your needs and personal space.

My personal motto would be, ""Never wish life was better, only you were Better""

::::THIS IS WHAT I WILL TELL YOU TO EXPECT POSITIVE AND NEGATIVES::::

Positive: I will help and make things easier for you in your stay, pick up from station when I can, leave food out if your hungry and you don't mind trying my/my family's food, and try and give you tips to save yourself here and there. I will as a host try and take care of you.

Negative: I am not a butler, you will be expected to clean up after yourself, follow house rules, keep the kitchen and public area in some order. You have to wear slippers (YES it is an Asian House), and sometimes other people will be staying so you do have to respect their space. I will also expect you to communicate if you wish to extend your stay or are running late.
___________________________________________________________________




All prices include, fully furnished, basic breakfast and tea and coffee, bread, pickup from station and clear directions to maximize your travellers time in the city ( As I am quite a traveller myself). Also wireless internet, toilet paper, soap and clean towels and access to a washing machine and kitchen which needs to be used carefully.

I also believe food is a great way to connect people and I love to source ingredients from markets and cook for my guests and it would be great if we could sit down over a meal and do the same and be able to do that. I am also able to converse in a variety of topics which include culture, music, politics and travel and would love to use a meal to get to know you as well. So all the prices MAY (depending on schedule) a personal cooking together and experience as we get to know each other if schedule suits.

I ONLY host people who I feel are in the same headspace and GENERALLY (but not always) no large families and people who BARGAIN BASEMENT my prices as they already very competitive.

I have been a French teacher, English to migrant teacher, many other things but now I have a catering business and work from home making delicious smells.
I've been living in Oz for 40 or more years, originally from UK...
Spend my leisure scuba diving, walking, gym, gardening, swimming and lots of theatre... in fact anything that's on offer! 
I especially love travelling, music festivals around the world and meeting new people.  I guess my motto is to work hard, play hard!
I really enjoy meeting all my happy guests, showing them my favourite places and just being there for them.  We learn so much from each other.

Of course I am sensitive to your privacy, and there if you need more wine!

I have lived and travelled extensively - San Francisco, Tokyo, Saigon and outside of London when I was a child.  Love to travel and meet new people, particularly those from other places.

Have seen quite a bit of the US (my dad took me to New York for my 14th birthday!!) and been on safari in Africa but not made it to other continents yet.  
Can't imagine life without friends, good spicy food and the prospect of another travel adventure.  Have backpacked, and travelled in style, kayaked down rivers and even hiked the Kokoda Track sharing a backpack with my boyfriend of the time.  I continue to travel now with perhaps the focus being on catching up with beloved friends all over the world from the days of living and working overseas.
Now prefer softer options along with a good bottle of wine, delicious food of the region wherever, classical music or some great rock.

Totally topped by seeing whales passing by too (at certain times of year) - come and stay at my place and you will want to move to Coogee, Sydney, Australia as well :) I love Summer and swimming in the ocean at all points of the day (and occasional dips during Summer eves too) and also yoga overlooking gorgeous Coogee beach. Also, have just gotten into cycling- as have many Sydney-siders and it is great riding to Surry Hills (where I work and one of the best places for great cafes, shops, theatres and galleries) and do so via Centennial Park, a truly beautiful park. 

I love festivals, particularly world music festivals and film festivals. Sydney has heaps of festivals, so come and enjoy :) food festivals, short (Italian, Human Rights, Gay/ Lesbian/ Transgender, Docos, Bike) film festivals, music festivals, etc etc. It's hard to choose, even when you live here....and when it is equally fun just hanging out at the beach. 

Contact me for dates as I'm not great at keeping my calendar up-to-date and also sometimes I can be flexible with dates, so I like to hear from peeps directly.

I love living near the beach.  There is nothing better than getting up and going for an early morning swim before work.  I have lived in Bondi for over 10 years and for some reason never learned to surf.  Stupid really as it's so accessible for me.  I have had a few lessons over the years but never followed it through. Anyway I just enjoy everything else the beach has to offer.

During the last decade Potts Point has become recognised as one of the most desirable places to live in Sydney. Many empty-nesters have sold their family homes in the suburbs and bought an apartment in the neighbourhood. Many young families now choose to live here, so much so that the sight of prams, once as rare in Potts Point as koalas, are now part of the diverse mix of locals. And why wouldn't anybody want to live here? It is the most cosmopolitan 'hood' in Australia. It is beautiful, grand old art deco buildings, and harbour side parks; it is a walk to the city through the Botanic Gardens; you can get a coffee downstairs, and have a drink after dinner. It is all about amenity. It is a vibrant, living, inner-urban community.",‚òÖ Parking. Parking is subject to availability. The cost is $25 per day and must be booked at the time of your reservation.,"It is two minutes walk to the nearest train station or you can walk into the CBD in fifteen minutes. There is a go-get car for hire by the hour on the street. Harbour-side parks are 5 minutes walk. The surf beaches are also a short train/ bus ride away.

We love it and think it is the best neighbourhood in Sydney. It is full of life - cafes, restaurants, bars, markets, shops and parks. If Potts Point does not have it, it is nearby by foot, taxi or public transport. It is rated as the most liveable part of Sydney.

We like to travel. I have been fortunate enough to live in Singapore (Tanglin School), France (Dijon - Universite di Bourgogne), Holland (Delft), Italy (Perugia - Universita per Stranieri), UK (London), PNG (Moresby) and Germany (Hamburg). Our experience in travelling and living abroad has been distilled into our apartments.

Airbnb gives us the opportunity to offer to you the five homes we own (not just manage) in this neighbourhood for your stay in Sydney.

All our homes are well designed, comfortable, clean, secure and fully equipped with everything you will need to enjoy your holiday or business trip. We live a minute away so we are available should you need something.
